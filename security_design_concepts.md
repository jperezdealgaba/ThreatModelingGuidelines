# Security Design Concepts

- **Complete mediation:** The principle of complete mediation requires that all
accesses to objects be checked to ensure that they are allowed.
-  **Separation of duties:** The principle that no user should be given enough privileges to misuse the system on their own.
- **Defense in depth:**   An information security strategy that integrates people, technology, and operations capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of the organization.
- **Fail secure:** A security principle that aims to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability by swithcing to a secure state upon software failure.
- **Echnomy of mechanisms:** The principle of economy of mechanism states that security mechanisms should be as simple as possible (also known as Keep it simple)
- **Open design:** The principle that states that your system security shouldn't rely on the secrecy of your implementation This is highly related to cryprography and Kerchkoff's principle.
- **Least Common mechanisms**: Minimize the amount of mechanism common to more than one user and depended on by all users.
- **Phycological acceptability:** a security mechanism should not make accessing a resource, or taking some other action, more difficult than it would be if the security mechanism were not present.
- **Weakest link:** The principle states that the security of the software depend on the protection of its weakest components,
- **Leveraging existing components:** Principle that focuses on making sure that the attack surface is not increased at the time of enhacing the functionality of the code by reusing existing software components.
